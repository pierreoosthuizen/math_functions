# math_functions

## primecheck.swift
This extends the Int class in Swift, adding a new function isPrime.
The function is called from the Int object after it has been intialized.

```swift
let myInteger = 5

if myInteger.isPrime {
  print ("My integer is prime!")
} else {
  print ("My integer is not prime.")
}
```
